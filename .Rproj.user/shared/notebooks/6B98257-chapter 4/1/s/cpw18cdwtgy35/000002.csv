"
"2","For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
"
"2","For improved execution time, we recommend calling
Sys.setenv(LOCAL_CPPFLAGS = '-march=native')
although this causes Stan to throw an error on a few processors.
